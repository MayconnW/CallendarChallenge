# React Challenge

## How to deploy

- Run `npm install` | `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm start` | `yarn run` to run the app locally.
- You can find the project running on `localhost:3000`.

### Notes

I'm sending a video showing the website running.

To run the app, just install de dependencies using npm or yarn and run the start script.

There is a ".env" file on the root. I know it is not a good practice to have this file on version control, but to make easier to run the app, I just create this file and commit it.

The biggest challenge was to create the logic to show the days in the correct place in the calendar.

I mixed some concepts and libs here just to show I'm able to work with different kind of projects.

I do prefer to use yarn instead of npm, but because the project already had the package-lock file, I used npm.

If I had more time, I should setup the redux and saga, and then remove the complexity from the components.

If I was start a React project today, I think I wouldn't use react-scripts even I like it, but today I would use Vite.

That's it.

Follow the link of the video. If is is hard to understand please let me know and I try to record again.
